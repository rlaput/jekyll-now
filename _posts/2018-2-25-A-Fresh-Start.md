title: A Fresh Start
---

I just woke up this afternoon thinking about what to do with my free time. I didn't have the luxury of time until now. Gone are the days when I would just think about work every time I'm out of bed. I've been a part of a team that finished a very large and successful project and I'm on to the next one. It was a very busy project, tasks were overflowing our project management tool that even other tasks were just verbally given. I am very thankful for being part of the project and I consider it as a career booster.

In my experience, one of the challenges of being a software developer is looking for resources to complete the tasks given. I remember when I started programming, my browser history was full of google search like:

>difference between IQueryable and IEnumerable

or even guides like

>how to implement timezone localization by user in asp.net mvc

There are a lot of sources online and I am very thankful to the authors for giving me ideas to get the job done.

I'm thinking of contributing to those sources and share my experiences as a developer. _I would rather be the one who shares his food rather than someone who makes himself obese._

I think that's it for now. Maybe the next post will be a technical one. This post is to get me started with markdown blogging. Thanks for reading.
